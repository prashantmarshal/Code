1. Area of triangle:
[ x1(y2 – y3) + x2(y3 – y1) + x3(y1-y2)]/2

Q. Find if a point lies inside the rectangle:

Ans. Create four triangles and calculate their area. If area 4(triangles) == area rectangle, then true.

2. How to check if given four points form a square

Ans. The idea is to pick any point and calculate its distance from rest of the points. Let the picked picked point be ‘p’. To form a square, distance of two points must be same from ‘p’, let this distance be d. The distance from one point must be different from that d and must be equal to √2 times d. Let this point with different distance be ‘q’.
The above condition is not good enough as the the point with different distance can be on the other side. We also need to check that q is at same distance from 2 other points and this distance is same as d.
